1. create an array of length = 25 with random integers
   from the range [10..50]
2. write a function(method) which will sort the array
   in ascending order
   ANY COLLECTIONS AND JAVA METHODS FOR SORTING
   ARE FORBIDDEN TO USE (NO ANY IMPORTS)
   allowed only: int[], =, for, if, while, print
   * don't invent the bicycle, reuse random generator
     from previous tasks
3. print source array and sorted array
3. explain the complexity in a way you understand
4. can you improve your solution?
